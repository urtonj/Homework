The mobile market has become increasingly important as more and more people adopt smartphones and begin to use them for tasks that they may have used a full-sized computer for in the past. Thus, it is clearly important for businesses to adapt to this new computing paradigm, making their websites capable of handling mobile user traffic in a manner that is comfortable for the visitor. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are a couple of options for establishing a mobile presence given the existence of a conventional web site. First, businesses may choose to release a full, rich mobile application enabling full functionality for their service. This approach would perhaps guarantee the best experience for the user, but is not ideal since it requires building a separate application that replicates all necessary functionality for each of the major smartphone platforms (Android, iOS, BlackBerry). A second option is to create a full website made specifically for customers visiting from mobile devices. This could either be accomplished by registering and creating a whole new site (usually a .mobi, I believe) or by establishing a subdomain (like m.mysite.com) which users on smartphones are redirected to. The drawback to this solution is that it requires development of a whole new reconfigured website which must be integrated into existing systems. A final approach would be to simply adapt the stylesheets for an existing web site such that the display parameters are altered to be suitable for viewing on a mobile device. Though I have not had personal experience with this approach, it seems as though it could be difficult to reformat all of the content that fits on a normal web page to be suitable for a mobile device.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It appears that BlueTrain Mobile is using the second of these approaches, though they don&rsquo;t seem to mention this explicitly anywhere (in the images on the home page you can see a mobile subdomain is in use). Of the three, this approach seems to be perhaps the most reasonable, as it assures a quality user experience without fragmenting content into a separate mobile application.</span></p></body></html>
